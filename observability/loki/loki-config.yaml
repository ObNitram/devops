common:
# Loki is composed of multiple microservices that communicate with each other (gRPC).
# The `instance_addr` is the address each microservice uses for inter-service communication.
# We use the [monolithic mode](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/get-started/deployment-modes/#monolithic-mode) for simplicity.
# Therefore, we set the address to 127.0.0.1 so services can communicate with each other,
# even when the container IP changes during upgrades.

# By default, Loki will send anonymous, but uniquely-identifiable usage and configuration
# analytics to Grafana Labs. These statistics are sent to https://stats.grafana.org/
#
# Statistics help us better understand how Loki is used, and they show us performance
# levels for most users. This helps us prioritize features and documentation.
# For more information on what's sent, look at
# https://github.com/grafana/loki/blob/main/pkg/analytics/stats.go
# Refer to the buildReport method to see what goes into a report.
